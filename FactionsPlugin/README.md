#FactionsPlugin  
Full featured and stable factions plugin!  

** NOTE: This plugin is not done! It's still a work in progress! **  
###### Check this repository for when a stable release is ready, or message me!  

### What is this plugin?  
This plugin is called FactionsPlugin! It's a project I started to work on.  
The original concept was a private commission for a person requesting me, but  
I decided to make a public release of a large factions plugin.  

### Why should I use this plugin, and not FactionsPro?  
You can use FactionsPro if you want. But... the benefits of this factions plugin  
is great. I developed it with a object-oriented concept in mind, and it started  
with a surprisingly stable foundation.  

Technically saying, I think this plugin has very stable features, as I designed it  
to be. Object-oriented, reliable saving solution, and it's fully customizable too!  

### When will it be released?  
Soon enough. I develop it on weekends mostly...   
Track this repository for progress.  

### What are this plugin's confirmed features?  
This is not the full list, as I'm sure I will be adding more features before it's  
full release...
